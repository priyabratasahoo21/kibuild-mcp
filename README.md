# KiBuild MCP

A self-contained MCP server that gives any AI coding tool deep, read-level access to a Claris FileMaker schema — no FileMaker license required at runtime for schema analysis.

Register one binary in your MCP config. Your AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code) immediately gains FileMaker-aware tools: script navigation, impact analysis across the full dependency graph, XML generation and validation, specialist skills, and live FileMaker execution when the KiBuild plugin is connected.

---

## What it does

### Schema navigation
Find any script, layout, or table by name with fuzzy matching. Returns the sanitized step list, sibling scripts, and the raw XML path — everything the AI needs to reason about the schema without reading raw XML itself.

### Full dependency graph (16 reference tools)
Trace anything to anything: which layouts trigger a script, which scripts navigate to a layout, where a field is used in calculations or join predicates, which value lists appear in layout controls. Every reference tool walks the exploded schema XML and returns structured JSON with file paths and line-level snippets.

### XML analysis and generation
Extract and list script steps from XML, validate generated FMXML snippets against 7 structural rules before they reach FileMaker, validate WebViewer HTML for remote dependencies and risky APIs, and write versioned artifacts to the project outbox for review.

### Specialist skills
Load curated FileMaker skill prompts (`pro_scriptwriter`, `script_analysis`, `fm_xml_serializer`, `script_debug`) directly into AI context to inject domain-specific guidance for writing, analyzing, or debugging scripts.

### Live FileMaker execution (optional)
When the KiBuild C++ plugin is running and connected, `run_script` and `execute_sql` execute against the active FileMaker database over IPC. All other 34 tools work without FileMaker running.

## Prerequisites

- **Exported FileMaker schema** — Use the KiBuild plugin's `Export Schema` button, or FileMaker's built-in DDR export tool, to produce an exploded schema folder:
  ```
  your-project/
  └── files/
      └── Schema/
          └── YourDatabase/
              ├── scripts/
              ├── scripts_sanitized/
              ├── layouts/
              ├── tables/
              └── relationships/
  ```
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** — Pre-compiled binaries are provided for all three.
- **No Go toolchain required** unless you are building from source.

### Where the schema XML can come from

The server indexes an **exploded** schema folder — one XML file *per object*, grouped into `scripts/`, `layouts/`, `tables/`, and `relationships/` (shown above). Several things can produce FileMaker XML; they differ in how much "exploding" is left to do:

| Source | Output | Ready to index? |
|---|---|---|
| KiBuild plugin **Export Schema** | Exploded tree, one file per object | ✅ Directly |
| Built-in **DDR** export | One `FMPReport` document for the whole solution | Not yet supported |
| **Save a Copy as XML** — single file | One `FMSaveAsXML` document for the whole solution | ✅ Via `explode_xml_export` |
| **Save a Copy as XML** — per-catalog option | One file per *catalog* (`<DB>_ScriptCatalog.xml`, `<DB>_LayoutCatalog.xml`, `<DB>_BaseTableCatalog.xml`, …) | ✅ Via `explode_xml_export` |

FileMaker 2025/2026's native **Save a Copy as XML** (available as both a menu command and a script step, configured via JSON options) is a convenient, license-friendly way to get schema XML out without the plugin. It emits the `FMSaveAsXML` dialect either as one document, or — with the `per catalog` option — as one `<DB>_<Catalog>Catalog.xml` file per catalog in a destination folder.

The catch: **per-catalog is not per-object.** Even with the split enabled, *all* scripts stay combined inside a single `ScriptCatalog`, all layouts inside `LayoutCatalog`, and so on — FileMaker does not explode each script into its own file, while the indexing tools here expect one file per object.

The built-in **`explode_xml_export`** tool closes that gap. Point it at either form (the single `FMSaveAsXML` file or the split-catalog folder — it auto-detects) and it writes the per-object layout the indexer needs, then run `generate_schema_map`:

```
Explode the Save-as-XML export at /path/to/Contacts.xml into my project, then build the schema map.
```

> **Coverage:** `explode_xml_export` currently explodes the **scripts** catalog into `scripts/*.xml` + `scripts_sanitized/*.txt` (full script-analysis and reference tools work). Layouts, base tables, and relationships are not exploded yet — for those, use the KiBuild plugin's Export Schema, or a community tool such as *FM-XML-Export-Exploder*, until support lands.

## Setup

### Step 1 — Point the binary at your project

**Option A — Environment variable** (recommended for MCP configs):

```json
"env": { "KIBUILD_ACTIVE_PROJECT": "/path/to/your/project" }
```

**Option B — Active project file**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.fm_ai_bridge
echo "/path/to/your/project" > ~/.fm_ai_bridge/active_project.txt
```

### Step 2 — Register in your AI tool's MCP config

#### Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kibuild": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/kibuild-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "KIBUILD_ACTIVE_PROJECT": "/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kibuild": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/kibuild-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "KIBUILD_ACTIVE_PROJECT": "/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kibuild": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/kibuild-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "KIBUILD_ACTIVE_PROJECT": "/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code (with MCP extension)

Add to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "kibuild": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/kibuild-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "KIBUILD_ACTIVE_PROJECT": "/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3 — Build the workspace index

Ask your AI tool to call `generate_schema_map`. This scans the schema folder and writes `workspace_map.md` to your project root — after that, `search_index` and all navigation tools are live.

```
Call generate_schema_map for my project at /path/to/your/project
```

The index auto-refreshes whenever schema files change.

---

## Quick start

Once registered, ask your AI tool natural questions:

```
Find the script "Create Invoice" and show me what it does.
```
```
Which scripts call "Send Email Notification"?
```
```
Where is the Status field used across scripts, layouts, and calculations?
```
```
List all layouts that reference the Invoices table occurrence.
```
```
Show me the relationships for the Contacts table occurrence.
```
```
Validate this FMXML snippet before I import it.
```

---

## Disabling specific tools

Add a `kibuild_config.json` file to `~/.fm_ai_bridge/`:

```json
{
  "disabled_mcp_tools": ["run_script", "execute_sql"]
}
```

Any tool name listed there is excluded from `tools/list` and blocked at call time.

Writes `scripts/<name>.xml` + `scripts_sanitized/<name>.txt` under `Schema/<database>/`; run `generate_schema_map` afterward. |

### Specialist skills

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `load_skill` | Load a specialist skill by ID into AI context. Available skills: `pro_scriptwriter` (FileMaker scripting patterns), `script_analysis` (structured script audit), `fm_xml_serializer` (valid FMXML generation rules), `script_debug` (systematic debugging approach). |

### Live FileMaker execution — requires KiBuild plugin

These tools require FileMaker to be open with the KiBuild plugin loaded. They gracefully error when the plugin is absent without affecting the other 34 tools.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `run_script` | Run a FileMaker script by name, with an optional parameter. |
| `execute_sql` | Execute an `ExecuteSQL` query against the active database and return results. |

## Logging

The server logs all MCP traffic to `~/.fm_ai_bridge/mcp_server.log`. Tail it to debug tool calls:

```bash
tail -f ~/.fm_ai_bridge/mcp_server.log
```
