# KiBuild MCP

A self-contained MCP server that gives any AI coding tool deep, read-level access to a Claris FileMaker schema — no FileMaker license required at runtime for schema analysis.

Register one binary in your MCP config. Your AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code) immediately gains FileMaker-aware tools: script navigation, impact analysis across the full dependency graph, XML generation and validation, and specialist skills.

---

## What it does

### Schema navigation
Find any script, layout, or table by name with fuzzy matching. Returns the sanitized step list, sibling scripts, and the raw XML path — everything the AI needs to reason about the schema without reading raw XML itself.

### Full dependency graph (16 reference tools)
Trace anything to anything: which layouts trigger a script, which scripts navigate to a layout, where a field is used in calculations or join predicates, which value lists appear in layout controls. Every reference tool walks the exploded schema XML and returns structured JSON with file paths and line-level snippets.

### XML analysis and generation
Extract and list script steps from XML, validate generated FMXML snippets against 7 structural rules before they reach FileMaker, validate WebViewer HTML for remote dependencies and risky APIs, and write versioned artifacts to the project outbox for review.

### Specialist skills
Load curated FileMaker skill prompts (`pro_scriptwriter`, `script_analysis`, `fm_xml_serializer`, `script_debug`) directly into AI context to inject domain-specific guidance for writing, analyzing, or debugging scripts.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Exported FileMaker schema** — Use the KiBuild plugin's `Export Schema` button, or FileMaker's built-in DDR export tool, to produce an exploded schema folder:
  ```
  your-project/
  └── files/
      └── Schema/
          └── YourDatabase/
              ├── scripts/
              ├── scripts_sanitized/
              ├── layouts/
              ├── tables/
              └── relationships/
  ```
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** — Pre-compiled binaries are provided for all three.
- **No Go toolchain required** unless you are building from source.

### Where the schema XML can come from

The server indexes an **exploded** schema folder — one XML file *per object*, grouped into `scripts/`, `layouts/`, `tables/`, and `relationships/` (shown above). Several things can produce FileMaker XML; they differ in how much "exploding" is left to do:

| Source | Output | Ready to index? |
|---|---|---|
| KiBuild plugin **Export Schema** | Exploded tree, one file per object | ✅ Directly |
| Built-in **DDR** export | One `FMPReport` document for the whole solution | Not yet supported |
| **Save a Copy as XML** — single file | One `FMSaveAsXML` document for the whole solution | ✅ Via `explode_xml_export` |
| **Save a Copy as XML** — per-catalog option | One file per *catalog* (`<DB>_ScriptCatalog.xml`, `<DB>_LayoutCatalog.xml`, `<DB>_BaseTableCatalog.xml`, …) | ✅ Via `explode_xml_export` |

FileMaker 2025/2026's native **Save a Copy as XML** (available as both a menu command and a script step, configured via JSON options) is a convenient, license-friendly way to get schema XML out without the plugin. It emits the `FMSaveAsXML` dialect either as one document, or — with the `per catalog` option — as one `<DB>_<Catalog>Catalog.xml` file per catalog in a destination folder.

The catch: **per-catalog is not per-object.** Even with the split enabled, *all* scripts stay combined inside a single `ScriptCatalog`, all layouts inside `LayoutCatalog`, and so on — FileMaker does not explode each script into its own file, while the indexing tools here expect one file per object.

The built-in **`explode_xml_export`** tool closes that gap. Point it at either form (the single `FMSaveAsXML` file or the split-catalog folder — it auto-detects) and it writes the per-object layout the indexer needs, then run `generate_schema_map`:

```
Explode the Save-as-XML export at /path/to/Contacts.xml into my project, then build the schema map.
```

> **Coverage:** `explode_xml_export` explodes **every catalog** in the export, one file per object under `Schema/<database>/`:
> - `scripts/*.xml` + `scripts_sanitized/*.txt` — full script analysis and reference tools
> - `tables/*.xml` — base tables with their fields joined in (find_table, calculation/field references)
> - `layouts/*.xml`, `relationships/*.xml`, `table_occurrences/*.xml` — navigation, impact analysis, relationship predicates
> - `valuelists/`, `custom_functions/`, `custom_menus/`, `accounts/`, `privilege_sets/`, `extended_privileges/`, `themes/`, `base_directories/`, `external_data_sources/` — exploded for completeness and Git diffing
>
> The indexer reads `tables/`, `layouts/`, `relationships/`, `table_occurrences/`, and `scripts/`; the remaining folders are split out for browsing/version control. Script folders are flattened and name collisions disambiguated by id; relationship files are named after the joined table occurrences.

## Installation

### Step 1 — Get the binary

**Option A — Download a release binary (recommended)**

Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/priyabratasahoo21/kibuild-mcp/releases) and download the binary for your platform:

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `kibuild-mcp-darwin-arm64` |
| macOS (Intel) | `kibuild-mcp-darwin-amd64` |
| Linux | `kibuild-mcp-linux-amd64` |
| Windows | `kibuild-mcp-windows-amd64.exe` |

Then move it to a permanent location on your PATH:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x kibuild-mcp-darwin-arm64
mv kibuild-mcp-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/kibuild-mcp
```
The binary now lives at `/usr/local/bin/kibuild-mcp`. Use this path in your MCP config below.

> On macOS, the first time you run it you may need to allow it in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Create a folder for CLI tools if you don't have one
mkdir "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\kibuild-mcp"
Move-Item kibuild-mcp-windows-amd64.exe "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\kibuild-mcp\kibuild-mcp.exe"
# Add to PATH (run once, then restart your terminal)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $env:PATH + ";$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\kibuild-mcp", "User")
```
The binary lives at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\kibuild-mcp\kibuild-mcp.exe`. Use this full path in your MCP config below.

**Option B — Homebrew (macOS / Linux)**

```bash
brew install kibuild/tap/kibuild-mcp
```

> Homebrew tap coming soon.

**Option C — Build from source**

Requires Go 1.21 or later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/priyabratasahoo21/kibuild-mcp.git
cd kibuild-mcp
go build -o kibuild-mcp .
mv kibuild-mcp /usr/local/bin/
```

## Setup

### Step 2 — Register in your AI tool

Pick your tool below. Paste the snippet into the config file shown, replacing `/path/to/your/project` with the absolute path to your FileMaker project folder.

> **Where is my project folder?** It's the folder that contains (or will contain) your `files/Schema/` export. The same path you would pass to `generate_schema_map`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kibuild": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/kibuild-mcp",

  }
}
```

### Step 3 — Build the workspace index

Once the server is registered, ask your AI tool:

```
Call generate_schema_map for my project at /path/to/your/project
```

This scans your `files/Schema/` folder and writes `workspace_map.md` to your project root. After that, all navigation and reference tools are live. The index auto-refreshes whenever schema files change.

---

## Quick start

Once registered, ask your AI tool natural questions:

```
Find the script "Create Invoice" and show me what it does.
```
```
Which scripts call "Send Email Notification"?
```
```
Where is the Status field used across scripts, layouts, and calculations?
```
```
List all layouts that reference the Invoices table occurrence.
```
```
Show me the relationships for the Contacts table occurrence.
```
```
Validate this FMXML snippet before I import it.
```

## Logging

The server logs all MCP traffic to `~/.fm_ai_bridge/mcp_server.log`. Tail it to debug tool calls:

```bash
tail -f ~/.fm_ai_bridge/mcp_server.log
```
